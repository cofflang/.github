## Welcome to the Coff Compiler GitHub Organization! 👋

This is a long-term project by [@tavro](https://github.com/tavro), hopefully, eventually, this will become a collection of the source code associated with the compiler coff. This includes an operating system, a browser engine and a text editor. Come back in 10 years, and there might be something here. I hope you're patient :-)
